# ModernMediaPlayer
A modern UI design of a media player and fully functional backend, made in WinForms using .NET framework 4.7.2 
Started as an UI only project but I have since implemented complete music player features in it

 Some logos and icons were provided by Rj Code Advanced

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate responsive design and modern UI design techniques using WinForms

The end result was a fully responsive UI with side menu and sliding panels, as seen below:

Since release, the app got more features and designs done:
